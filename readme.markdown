### About

BattleSnakes is a realtime game developed with NodeJS / NowJS on the server and PaperJS / jQuery on the client.  It was created in less than 2 weeks by Derek Anderson for the NowJS realtime game competition from September 16th to September 30th, 2011. The awesome Logo was created by Trevor Burks (trevorburks.com)  

The source is available for non-commercial, educational purposes. I plan to modify and launch a full-featured version of the game in the near future.  


### Usage

1. install NodeJS and NPM
2. Install the required NPM modules by typing `npm install` in the root directory of this app.
3. Run the game with `node server.js`
4. Fire up your trusty browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` - invite some friends on your local network!
